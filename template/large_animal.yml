# Datatypes
raw_file_types: ["text documentation", "tabular data"]
tech_types: ["veterinary research involving large animals"]
file_sizes: "less than 1 MB per sample"

# Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so
sharing_non_hs: "Medical records and clinical pathology data will be preserved and shared to facilitate re-analysis and re-use of the data by other investigators."

# Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation
metadata: "Metadata on medical record information will be collected via report features in our core database and will be submitted in accordance with FAIR data principles."

# Related Tools, Software and/or Code
tools: ["The raw and processed %1% generated by this study can be accessed and manipulated using standard office suite spreadsheet software."]

# Standards for collection, etc.
standards: "The large animal data produced in this project will be collected using the standards established by the Comparative Medicine Shared Resource and ARRIVE Guidelines (Animal Research: Reporting in Vivo Experiments)."

# Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived
repository: "Primary repositories for medical records will be web-based software and internal server backups for raw data that require access controls."

# How scientific data will be findable and identifiable
findable: ["Summaries of relevant large animal data will be published and referred to where necessary in the Data Availability sections of all manuscripts."]

# When and how long the scientific data will be made available
duration: "Data will be deposited at the time of publication and preserved for the duration of the grant funding."

# Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data
access_reuse: "Raw large animal data will not be shared because they can only be opened in a limited number of open-source software programs/proprietary, licensed viewing software."

# Whether access to scientific data will be controlled
control_approvals: "Large animal medical and clinical data published with manuscripts will be open-access and available publicly."

# Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants (IF APPLICABLE)
privacy_hs: "Data will be de-identified according to HIPAA and the Common Rule. All direct respondent identifiers (e.g., names, residence, email addresses) will be removed. Deidentification will be completed prior to the finalization of shared data files. Participants will have the opportunity to opt out of sharing during informed consent procedures. Once personally identifying information are removed from the data set and deleted, we will not be able to identify data associated with a specific research participant for removal from the dataset. Limited provisions for participantsâ€™ withdrawal of data from sharing protocols will be outlined in informed consent. Upon receipt of an NIH Award, the data for this study will be protected by a Certificate of Confidentiality."

# Oversight of Data Management and Sharing
oversight: "Oversight for, management of and compliance with this data management and sharing plan will be performed by the PI for this project. Datasets generated by this project will be monitored and managed by Comparative Medicine veterinary staff, part of the Shared Resource group at Fred Hutch. They will review and update all experimental metadata at completion of studies and upon request by internal researchers."
