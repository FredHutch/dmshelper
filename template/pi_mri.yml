# Datatypes
raw_file_types: ["Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)"]
tech_types: ["7T Dry Magnet Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) instrument"]
file_sizes: "The amount of data generated per sample is 15 MB."

# Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so
sharing_non_hs: "DICOM files will be preserved and shared to facilitate re-analysis and re-use of the data by other investigators, due to the accessibility of viewing DICOM images using many commonly available image viewing applications."

# Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation
metadata: "Metadata on MRI data collection will be collected including hardware (field strength, manufacturer, model, RF coils), acquisition (pulse sequence, volume of interest locations, repetition time, total number of acquisitions), data analysis methods (analysis software, processing steps, output measure, quantification references) and data quality (reported variables, data exclusion criteria, and quality measures of postprocessing model fitting). Those metadata and associated documentation will be submitted in accordance with FAIR data principles."

# Related Tools, Software and/or Code
tools: ["The MRI data generated by this study can be accessed and manipulated using microDICOM software or ImageJ software.", "All code developed as a part of this proposal will be deposited on GitHub at publication and released open source with an MIT license."]

# Standards for collection, etc.
standards: "The preclinical imaging data produced in this project will be collected using the consensus recommendations established by the Minimum Reporting Standards for _in vivo_ Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRSinMRS)."

# Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived
repository: "Primary repositories for preclinical imaging and associated metadata will be The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), as well as the Imaging Data Commons (IDC), both maintained by the NIH/NCI."

# How scientific data will be findable and identifiable
findable: ["Both TCIA and the IDC provide stable IDs to imaging dataset collections representing the complete data collected for a particular publication. Primary references would be to a TCIA/IDC collection accession.", "Identifiers will also be listed in the Data Availability sections of all manuscripts published as part of this project."]

# When and how long the scientific data will be made available
duration: "Data will be deposited at the time of publication and preserved for the duration of the grant funding."

# Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data
access_reuse: "We do not anticipate any significant factors limiting the access, distribution, or reuse of %1% data."

# Whether access to scientific data will be controlled
control_approvals: "Data related to %1% will be open-access and available publicly."

# Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants (IF APPLICABLE)
privacy_hs: "Data will be de-identified according to HIPAA and the Common Rule. All direct respondent identifiers (e.g., names, residence, email addresses) will be removed. Deidentification will be completed prior to the finalization of shared data files. Participants will have the opportunity to opt out of sharing during informed consent procedures. Once personally identifying information are removed from the data set and deleted, we will not be able to identify data associated with a specific research participant for removal from the dataset. Limited provisions for participantsâ€™ withdrawal of data from sharing protocols will be outlined in informed consent. Upon receipt of an NIH Award, the data for this study will be protected by a Certificate of Confidentiality."

# Oversight of Data Management and Sharing
oversight: "Oversight for, management of and compliance with this data management and sharing plan will be performed by the PI for this project. We will review our plan and identify any datasets that need to be shared, processed for sharing or updated twice annually. Additionally, we will implement aspects of our plan when manuscripts are published."
