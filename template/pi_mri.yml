# Datatypes
raw_file_types: ["Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)"]
tech_types: ["7T Dry Magnet Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) instrument"]
file_sizes: "The amount of data generated per sample is 15MB."

# Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so
sharing_non_hs: "DICOM files will be preserved and shared to facilitate re-analysis and re-use of the data by other investigators, due to the accessibility of viewing DICOM images using many commonly available image viewing applications."

# Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation
metadata: "Metadata on MRI data collection will be collected including hardware (field strength, manufacturer, model, RF coils), acquisition (pulse sequence, volume of interest locations, repetition time, total number of acquisitions), data analysis methods (analysis software, processing steps, output measure, quantification references) and data quality (reported variables, data exclusion criteria, and quality measures of postprocessing model fitting). Those metadata and associated documentation will be submitted in accordance with FAIR data principles."

# Related Tools, Software and/or Code
tools: ["The MRI data generated by this study can be accessed and manipulated using the microDICOM software (available at https://www.microdicom.com/) or ImageJ software (available at https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html).", "All code developed as a part of this proposal will be deposited on GitHub at publication and released open source with an MIT license."]

# Standards for collection, etc.
standards: "The immune monitoring data produced in this project will be collected using the standards established by ___ ."

# Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived
repository: "Primary repositories for immune monitoring files will be [insert repositories] for data that can be made publicly available and [insert repositories] for data that require access controls."

# How scientific data will be findable and identifiable
findable: "[Insert repository names] provide stable IDs to [insert levels such as project accession, SRA read accession, sequencing platform, etc.]. Primary references would be to a GEO series accession or SRA run accession. The dataset records submitted for this project will additionally be listed in the Data Availability sections of all manuscripts published as part of this project."

# When and how long the scientific data will be made available
duration: "Data will be deposited at the time of publication and preserved for the duration of the grant funding."

# Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data
access_reuse: "We do not anticipate any significant factors limiting the access, distribution, or reuse of immune monitoring data."

# Whether access to scientific data will be controlled
control_approvals: ""

# Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants (IF APPLICABLE)
privacy_hs: ""

# Oversight of Data Management and Sharing
oversight: "Oversight for, management of and compliance with this data management and sharing plan will be performed by the PI for this project. We will review our plan and identify any datasets that need to be shared, processed for sharing or updated twice annually. Additionally, we will implement aspects of our plan when manuscripts are published."
