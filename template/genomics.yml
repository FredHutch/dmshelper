# Datatypes
raw_file_types: ["FASTQ", "BAM"]
tech_types: ["Illumina", "PacBio"]
file_sizes: "samples ranging from 500MB to 20GB each depending on the assay type and yield"
processing: "bioinformatics software to be described in all associated publications, resulting in structured data in tabular (CSV/TSV) or standardized genomic file formats (e.g. FASTA, BAM, VCF, HDF5). Processed files will range in size from from 100MB to 1GB depending on the specific analysis"

# Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so
sharing_hs: "To facilitate re-analysis and re-use of the data by other investigators, raw nucleotide sequence data in FASTQ format will be deposited in dbGaP. We will ensure that data submission is consistent, as appropriate, with all applicable national, tribal, and state laws and regulations. Key derived results, including alignments in BAM format or variant calls in VCF format, will be preserved and shared through appropriate public repositories such as dbGaP."
sharing_non_hs: "To facilitate re-analysis and re-use of the data by other investigators, raw nucleotide sequence data in FASTQ format will be deposited in GenBank or GEO. Key derived results, including alignments in BAM format or variant calls in VCF format, will be preserved and shared through appropriate public repositories GenBank or GEO."

# Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation
metadata: "Metadata will be collected and submitted in accordance with FAIR data principles in the form of a spreadsheet with consistent sample labels, dates in ISO 8601 format, without empty cells, with one data item per cell, organized as a single rectangle (with subjects as rows and variables as columns, and with a single header row), with a corresponding data dictionary. Metadata will be released in raw form without calculations on the raw data files, font color or highlighting as data, with human- and machine-readable variable names, links to raw data URLs, and saved as a plain text file."

# Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived
repository_hs: "Primary repositories for raw sequence data will be dbGaP for data that require access controls. This repository is backed by the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) for storage of raw sequence data, typically in FASTQ format, although uBAM files may be submitted instead. In addition to raw data, dbGaP accepts derived results (e.g., gene-barcode matrices, CRISPR sgRNA counts, etc.). Key derived results will accompany and be linked to corresponding raw data using standard SRA metadata spreadsheets. These data sharing repositories are managed and supported by the National Library of Medicine, and there is no current charge for submission or data hosting."
repository_non_hs: "Primary repositories for raw sequence data will be the Gene Expression Omnibus for data that can be made publicly available. This repository is backed by the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) for storage of raw sequence data, typically in FASTQ format, although uBAM files may be submitted instead. In addition to raw data, GEO accepts derived results (e.g., gene-barcode matrices, CRISPR sgRNA counts, etc.). Key derived results will accompany and be linked to corresponding raw data using standard SRA metadata spreadsheets. These data sharing repositories are managed and supported by the National Library of Medicine, and there is no current charge for submission or data hosting."

# How scientific data will be findable and identifiable
findable: "The SRA, GEO, and dbGaP repositories provide stable IDs to experiments (BioProject), sequencing data (SRR), and biological specimens (BioSample). Primary references would be to a GEO series accession or BioProject experiment accession. The dataset records submitted for this project will additionally be listed in the Data Availability sections of all manuscripts published as part of this project."

# When and how long the scientific data will be made available
duration_hs: "Alignment data will be submitted after data cleaning and quality control, aiming for within 3 months after data have been generated. Data will then be released on dbGaP 6 months after data submission. Any data linking genomic data to phenotype or other biological states will be submitted at publication. All data will be preserved for the duration of the grant funding."
duration_non_hs: "Data will be released no later than the time of initial publication and preserved for the duration of the grant funding."

# Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data
access_reuse: "[text about IRB...]"

# Whether access to scientific data will be controlled
control_approvals: ""

# Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants (IF APPLICABLE)
privacy_hs: "In order to achieve our goal of genomic data sharing with the research community while not violating assurances and rights of study participants, we will create a dataset for sharing that (1) excludes participants whose consent forms specifically state that their data will not be shared outside of the study team, and (2) incorporates standard blurring or masking techniques for demographic, phenotypic, and descriptive variables so as to reduce risks of identifiability and/or confidentiality violation."

# Oversight of Data Management and Sharing
oversight: "Oversight for, management of and compliance with this data management and sharing plan will be performed by the PI for this project. We will review our plan and identify any datasets that need to be shared, processed for sharing or updated twice annually. Additionally, we will implement aspects of our plan when manuscripts are published."
