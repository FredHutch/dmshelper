repository_if_anvil: "All shared study materials, data, and metadata will be made publicly available through the [Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL)](https://anvilproject.org/). Data upload is supported through a graphical user interface (GUI) and can be performed programmatically via APIs. Funds have been requested in this grant budget to support data curation and deposition. Details are found in the budget justification."

findable_if_anvil: "AnVIL enables finabilitiy through flexible workspaces with recommended minimal required metadata schemas to enable discoverability in a user-friendly catalog on the AnVIL Portal website. AnVIL offers several paradigms for data access. (1) Public data is made finable through AnVIL search and public workspaces. (2) Access can be granted manually via real-time data sharing for authorized individual users or for groups of users. (3) For protected data, AnVIL enables linking user IDs to authorization accounts, such as a dbGaP account via Terra Authorization Domains. (4) AnVIL also uses the Data Use Oversight System (DUOS) to support Data Access Committees (DACs) enabling automated, standardized access request review. We will register our study and datasets in DUOS with the appropriate NIH DAC. In addition, the dataset records submitted for this project will be listed in the Data Availability sections of all manuscripts published as part of this project."

duration_if_anvil: "Datasets underlying publications will be shared at or prior to initial publication date. Data we do not publish on will be shared before the end of this award. Shared data will be preserved according to AnVIL's data retention policy. Currently, AnVIL has no process for deleting or retiring data sets."
duration_if_anvil_genomics: "We will meet the data submission and release timeframes specified by the NIH GDS and DMS Policies, as described on NIH’s data sharing website and NHGRI’s data sharing policies and expectations webpage. We will submit genomic data no later than 3 months after observing that quality measures have been met. Genomic data will be released 6 months after they are submitted. Other datasets underlying publications will be shared at or prior to initial publication date. Currently, AnVIL has no process for deleting or retiring data sets; data will be available for as long as AnVIL/NHGRI preserves the dataset."
duration_if_anvil_genomics_hs: "We will begin submitting genomic data no later than 3 months after data from the first batch is generated and quality measures has been assessed. Genomic data will be released 6 months after they are submitted to AnVIL. Phenotypic and clinical data, metadata, and associated documentation will be submitted along with the genomic data files, and the dataset will be released in full by the time any results supported in whole or in part by this award are posted to a preprint or submitted to a journal. In the event that we do not publish on these data or a portion of the data, they will be released before the end of this award. Other datasets underlying publications will be shared at or prior to initial publication date. Currently, AnVIL has no process for deleting or retiring data sets; data will be available for as long as AnVIL/NHGRI preserves the dataset."

controls_approvals_if_anvil: "Data and metadata will be shared through AnVIL as open access. The NIH funding agency, e.g. the NHGRI Data Access Committee (DAC), will manage access to the controlled datasets. Users of the data in AnVIL must register with AnVIL and agree to the Terms of Use."
controls_approvals_if_anvil_hs: "Deidentified data and metadata will be shared through AnVIL as open access. Human subject data will be shared through AnVIL as controlled access to further protect research participants. The NIH funding agency, e.g. the NHGRI Data Access Committee (DAC), will manage access to the controlled datasets. Users of the data in AnVIL must register with AnVIL and agree to the Terms of Use. Data users also agree not to share or redistribute any data downloads."
controls_approvals_if_anvil_genomics_hs: "Individual-level genomic and clinical data will be shared via controlled-access. The NIH funding agency, e.g. the NHGRI Data Access Committee (DAC), will manage access to the dataset once it is released. Metadata, and associated documentation (such as study protocols) will be openly available on AnVIL."

oversight_if_anvil: "The study PI will be overseeing execution of this Data Management and Sharing Plan and will be assessing quality metrics and will determine when data are of a sufficient quality to be shared broadly via the AnVIL. Progress on data sharing will be reported in the Research Performance Progress Report. We will review our plan and identify any datasets that need to be shared, processed for sharing or updated twice annually. Additionally, we will implement aspects of our plan when manuscripts are published."
