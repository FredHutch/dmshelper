repository_if_anvil: "The <font color='OA799A'>NHGRI AnVIL platform</font> will be the primary repository for data and associated metadata produced in this study. Data upload is supported through a graphical user interface (GUI) and can be performed programmatically via APIs."

findable_if_anvil: "AnVIL enables finabilitiy through flexible workspaces with recommended minimal required metadata schemas to enable discoverability in a user-friendly catalog on the AnVIL Portal website. AnVIL offers several paradigms for data access. (1) Public data is made finable through AnVIL search and public workspaces. (2) Access can be granted manually via real-time data sharing for authorized individual users or for groups of users. (3) For protected data, AnVIL enables linking user IDs to authorization accounts, such as a dbGaP account via Terra Authorization Domains. (4) AnVIL also uses the Data Use Oversight System (DUOS) integrated with workspaces to support Data Access Committees (DACs) by enabling automated, standardized access request review. In addition, the dataset records submitted for this project will be listed in the Data Availability sections of all manuscripts published as part of this project."
