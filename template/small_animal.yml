# Datatypes
tech_types: ["_in vivo_ imaging technology", "hematology analyzers", "spreadsheets (Excel)"]
raw_file_types: ["both bioluminescence images (in TIFF format) as well as tabular summaries of hematology results and breeding records (in DOC and XLS format)"]
file_sizes: "approximately 10MB for a typical image"

# Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so
sharing_non_hs: "Bioluminescence images as well as hematology results and breeding records will be preserved and shared to facilitate re-analysis and re-use of the data by other investigators."

# Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation
metadata: "Metadata on animal breeding and health information will be collected via the the ARRIVE guidelines (Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments) for describing in vivo experiments and will be submitted in accordance with FAIR data principles."

# Related Tools, Software and/or Code
tools: ["The raw and processed large animal facility data generated by this study can be accessed and manipulated using standard office suite applications for viewing and manipulating text files and tabular data (e.g. Microsoft Word and Excel)."]

# Standards for collection, etc.
standards: "The large animal data produced in this project will be collected using the standards established by the Comparative Medicine Shared Resource and ARRIVE Guidelines (Animal Research: Reporting in Vivo Experiments)."

# Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived
repository: "Primary repositories for medical records will be web-based software and internal server backups for raw data that require access controls."

# How scientific data will be findable and identifiable
findable: "Summaries of relevant large animal data will be published. The medical record datasets submitted for this project will additionally be listed in the Data Availability sections of all manuscripts published as part of this project."

# When and how long the scientific data will be made available
duration: "Data will be deposited at the time of publication and preserved for the duration of the grant funding."

# Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data
access_reuse: "Raw large animal data will not be shared because they can only be opened in a limited number of open-source software programs/proprietary, licensed viewing software."

# Whether access to scientific data will be controlled
control_approvals: ""

# Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants (IF APPLICABLE)
privacy_hs: ""

# Oversight of Data Management and Sharing
oversight: "Oversight for, management of and compliance with this data management and sharing plan will be performed by the PI for this project. Datasets generated by this project will be monitored and managed by Comparative Medicine veterinary staff, part of the Shared Resource group at Fred Hutch. They will review and update all experimental metadata at completion of studies and upon request by internal researchers."
