# Datatypes
raw_file_types: ".raw"
tech_types: "tandem (MS/MS) mass spectrometry"
file_sizes: "samples ranging from 0.5 to 2 GB"
processing: "Thermo Scientific Proteome Discoverer v2.5 and provide analyzed results using the Proteome Discoverer viewer, resulting in pdResult, Excel, and image files. Processed files will range in size from from 1GB to 30GB"

# Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so
sharing_non_hs: "Both raw results in the form of spectra collected by the mass spectrometer as well as analyzed results in the form of detected peptides and proteins will be preserved and shared to facilitate re-analysis and re-use of the data by other investigators. By sharing raw data, we provide other researchers with the ability to re-search spectra as new peptide matches become available in protein database repositories. By sharing the peptides and proteins detected in our analysis of those spectra, we provide other researchers with the processed data which was used to motivate the conclusions drawn from our study."

# Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation
metadata: "Proteomics metadata on biological samples, processing, technical replicates, fractionation, instrumentation, and configuration will be collected using the [MAGE-TAB-Proteomics standard](https://psidev.info/magetab) and will be submitted in accordance with FAIR data principles."

# Related Tools, Software and/or Code
tools: "The raw proteomics data generated by this study can be accessed with the latest software version of ThermoScientific Freestyle, and processed data can be accessed and manipulated using the desktop software [ThermoScientific Proteome Discoverer v2.5](https://thermo.flexnetoperations.com/control/thmo/login), as well as the web-based proteomics analysis functionality provided by [MassIVE](https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/massive.jsp)."

# Standards for collection, etc.
standards: "The proteomics data produced in this project will be collected using the standards established by the [ProteomeXchange](http://www.proteomexchange.org/), a global consortium supporting open access to proteomics datasets since 2012. Each dataset defined by the ProteomeXchange is comprised of the data described by a single manuscript using the same data workflow (e.g. DDA). All such datasets are assigned a ProteomeXchange [PXD identifier](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/miriam/main/collections/MIR:00000513) (PXD + a six figure integer). Each datasets consists of (1) mass spectrometry output files (raw spectra as well as peak lists), (2) experimental and technical metadata (in the established PX XML format), (3) processed results (peptide/protein identification results at a minimum), and (4) any other associated files."

# Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived
repository: "Primary repositories for raw data will be [MassIVE](https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/massive.jsp) and/or [PRIDE](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/). MassIVE is a community resource developed by the NIH-funded Center for Computational Mass Spectrometry to promote the global, free exchange of mass spectrometry data. MassIVE datasets can be assigned ProteomeXchange accessions to satisfy publication requirements. The PRoteomics IDEntifications (PRIDE) Archive database is a centralized, standards compliant, public data repository for mass spectrometry proteomics data, including protein and peptide identifications and the corresponding expression values, post-translational modifications and supporting mass spectra evidence (both as raw data and peak list files). PRIDE is a core member in the ProteomeXchange (PX) consortium, which provides a standardized way for submitting mass spectrometry-based proteomics data to public-domain repositories. Datasets are submitted to ProteomeXchange via PRIDE and are handled by expert bio-curators. All PRIDE public datasets can also be searched in ProteomeCentral, the portal for all ProteomeXchange datasets."

# How scientific data will be findable and identifiable
findable: ["MassIVE and PRIDE provide stable IDs to proteomics experiment collections, which are associated in turn with metadata describing the experiment as well as the raw and processed data which was submitted. Any publications associated with an experiment can be listed directly, making the scientific data discoverable by searching for the associated publication. Primary references would be to a dataset record available in [MassIVE](https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/datasets.jsp) or [PRIDE](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive).", "Identifiers will also be listed in the Data Availability sections of all manuscripts published as part of this project."]

# When and how long the scientific data will be made available
duration: "Raw spectra as well as processed peptide and protein data will be deposited in MassIVE or PRIDE at the time of publication and preserved for the duration of the grant funding."

# Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data
access_reuse: "We do not anticipate any significant factors limiting the access, distribution, or reuse of proteomic data."

# Whether access to scientific data will be controlled
control_approvals: "All proteomics datasets stored in MassIVE or PRIDE will be available to requesting researchers without the need for approval."

# Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants (IF APPLICABLE)
privacy_hs: ""

# Oversight of Data Management and Sharing
oversight: "Oversight for, management of and compliance with this data management and sharing plan will be performed by the PI for this project. We will review our plan and identify any datasets that need to be shared, processed for sharing or updated twice annually. Additionally, we will implement aspects of our plan when manuscripts are published."
