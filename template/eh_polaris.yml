# Datatypes

processing_file_type: [".svc or .svn"]

# Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so
sharing_non_hs: "Images described above will be preserved and shared to facilitate re-analysis and re-use of the data by other investigators."

# Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation
metadata: "Metadata will be collected and submitted in accordance with FAIR data principles in the form of a spreadsheet with consistent sample labels, dates in ISO 8601 format, without empty cells, with one data item per cell, organized as a single rectangle (with subjects as rows and variables as columns, and with a single header row), with a corresponding data dictionary. Metadata will be released in raw form without calculations on the raw data files, font color or highlighting as data, with human- and machine-readable variable names, links to raw data URLs, and saved as a plain text file."

# Related Tools, Software and/or Code
tools: ["The raw and processed experimental hisopathology data generated by this study can be accessed and manipulated using [HALO Image Analysis software](https://indicalab.com/halo/).", "All code developed as a part of this proposal will be deposited on GitHub at publication and released open source with an MIT license."]

# Standards for collection, etc.
standards: "We will follow guidelines for [The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/) data submission, including appropriate supporting non-image data (e.g. patient outcomes, training classifiers/labels, tumor segmentations) using NIH Common Data Elements Repository for labeling."

# Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived
repository: "Primary repositories for experimental histopathology files will be [The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/)."

# How scientific data will be findable and identifiable
findable: ["Each published TCIA Collection has an associated data citation to aid in findability.", "Identifiers will also be listed in the Data Availability sections of all manuscripts published as part of this project."]

# When and how long the scientific data will be made available
duration: "Data will be deposited at the time of publication and preserved for the duration of the grant funding."

# Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data
access_reuse: ["We do not anticipate any significant factors limiting the access, distribution, or reuse of %1% data.", "Once the full analysis and de-identification is complete, experimental hisopathology data is moved to a public repository and made available to the research community."]

# Whether access to scientific data will be controlled
control_approvals: "Data related to %1% will be open-access and available publicly."

# Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants (IF APPLICABLE)
privacy_hs: "All experimental histopathology data is fully de-identified by TCIA in accordance with international standards, US laws and University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) IRB protocol requirements. All data is anonymized to the fullest extent possible at the submitting site, and then encrypted prior to transmission to UAMS. All incoming data is captured in a quarantine system and treated as if it contains PHI. All TCIA personnel are trained in HIPAA regulations and procedures. TCIA servers are managed by UAMS IT as if they were UAMS clinical systems."

# Oversight of Data Management and Sharing
oversight: "Oversight for, management of and compliance with this data management and sharing plan will be performed by the PI for this project. We will review our plan and identify any datasets that need to be shared, processed for sharing or updated twice annually. Additionally, we will implement aspects of our plan when manuscripts are published."
