# Datatypes
raw_file_types: ["TIFF"]
tech_types: ["JEOL JSM 6610LV SEM instrumentation and JEOL SEM Control User Interface (version 3.11)"]

# Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so
sharing_non_hs: "Raw and processed EM images will be preserved and shared to facilitate re-analysis and re-use of the data by other investigators."

# Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation
metadata: "Metadata will be collected and submitted in accordance with FAIR data principles in the form of a spreadsheet with consistent sample labels, dates in ISO 8601 format, without empty cells, with one data item per cell, organized as a single rectangle (with subjects as rows and variables as columns, and with a single header row), with a corresponding data dictionary. Metadata will be released in raw form without calculations on the raw data files, font color or highlighting as data, with human- and machine-readable variable names, links to raw data URLs, and saved as a plain text file."

# Related Tools, Software and/or Code
tools: "All code developed as a part of this proposal will be deposited on GitHub at publication and released open source with an MIT license."

# Standards for collection, etc.
standards: "Microscopy data will follow [Electron Microscopy Public Image Archive (EMPIAR)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/empiar/policies/#_w95koontmqn) requirements, including finalizing raw data in a compatible file format with associated metadata."

# Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived
repository: "Primary repositories for SEM data will be the [Electron Microscopy Public Image Archive (EMPIAR)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/empiar/)."

# How scientific data will be findable and identifiable
findable: ["A public EMPIAR accession code is assigned immediately after the user submits the deposition. The accession code is sent in an automatic email to the depositor and the owner(s).", "The dataset records submitted for this project will additionally be listed in the Data Availability sections of all manuscripts published as part of this project."]

# When and how long the scientific data will be made available
duration: "Data will be deposited at the time of publication and preserved for the duration of the grant funding."

# Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data
access_reuse: "We do not anticipate any significant factors limiting the access, distribution, or reuse of cellular imaging data."

# Whether access to scientific data will be controlled
control_approvals: ""

# Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants (IF APPLICABLE)
privacy_hs: ""

# Oversight of Data Management and Sharing
oversight: "Oversight for, management of and compliance with this data management and sharing plan will be performed by the PI for this project. We will review our plan and identify any datasets that need to be shared, processed for sharing or updated twice annually. Additionally, we will implement aspects of our plan when manuscripts are published."
