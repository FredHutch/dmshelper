# Datatypes
raw_file_types: ["tabular data in Excel format"]
tech_types: ["automated cell counters"]
file_sizes: "less than 1MB per sample"

# Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so
sharing_non_hs: "Medical records and clinical pathology data will be preserved and shared to facilitate re-analysis and re-use of the data by other investigators."

# Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation
metadata: "Metadata will be collected and submitted in accordance with FAIR data principles in the form of a spreadsheet with consistent sample labels, dates in ISO 8601 format, without empty cells, with one data item per cell, organized as a single rectangle (with subjects as rows and variables as columns, and with a single header row), with a corresponding data dictionary. Metadata will be released in raw form without calculations on the raw data files, font color or highlighting as data, with human- and machine-readable variable names, links to raw data URLs, saved as a plain text file and uploaded with sequence data."

# Related Tools, Software and/or Code
tools: ["The raw and processed %1% generated by this study can be accessed and manipulated using standard office suite spreadsheet software.", "All code developed as a part of this proposal will be deposited on GitHub at publication and released open source with an MIT license."]

# Standards for collection, etc.
standards: "The therapeutic products data produced in this project will be collected using the standards established by the ProteomeXchange (http://www.proteomexchange.org/), a global consortium supporting open access to proteomics datasets since 2012. Each dataset defined by the ProteomeXchange is comprised of the data described by a single manuscript using the same data workflow (e.g. DDA). All such datasets are assigned a ProteomeXchange PXD identifier (PXD + a six figure integer, for additional details see: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/miriam/main/collections/MIR:00000513). Each datasets consists of (1) mass spectrometry output files (raw spectra as well as peak lists), (2) experimental and technical metadata (in the established PX XML format), (3) processed results (peptide/protein identification results at a minimum), and (4) any other associated files."

# Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived
repository: "Primary repositories for immune monitoring files will be [insert repositories] for data that can be made publicly available and [insert repositories] for data that require access controls."

# How scientific data will be findable and identifiable
findable: "[Insert repository names] provide stable IDs to [insert levels such as project accession, SRA read accession, sequencing platform, etc.]. Primary references would be to a GEO series accession or SRA run accession. The dataset records submitted for this project will additionally be listed in the Data Availability sections of all manuscripts published as part of this project."

# When and how long the scientific data will be made available
duration: "Data will be deposited at the time of publication and preserved for the duration of the grant funding."

# Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data
access_reuse: "We do not anticipate any significant factors limiting the access, distribution, or reuse of immune monitoring data."

# Whether access to scientific data will be controlled
control_approvals: ""

# Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants (IF APPLICABLE)
privacy_hs: ""

# Oversight of Data Management and Sharing
oversight: "Oversight for, management of and compliance with this data management and sharing plan will be performed by the PI for this project. Datasets generated by this project will be monitored and managed by Comparative Medicine veterinary staff, part of the Shared Resource group at Fred Hutch. They will review and update all experimental metadata at completion of studies and upon request by internal researchers."
