# Datatypes
raw_file_types: ["Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format", "TIFF"]
tech_types: ["Micro-Computed Tomography (micro-CT) on the Quantum GX2 platform"]
file_sizes: "The amount of data generated per sample is 277 or 140 MB for DICOM or TIFF files, respectively."
processing_tech: "microCT viewing software"
processing_file_type: ["JPEG", "PNG", "BMP"]

# Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so
sharing_non_hs: "Processed micro-CT images in DICOM or TIFF format will be preserved and shared to facilitate re-analysis and re-use of the data by other investigators. DICOM and TIFF files will be shared due to ease of access and the ability to open these files in many different, commonly available software applications. The raw data (VOX files) are not shared as the data is very large and unusable in most commonly used software applications."

# Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation
metadata: "Metadata will be collected and submitted in accordance with FAIR data principles in the form of a spreadsheet with consistent sample labels, dates in ISO 8601 format, without empty cells, with one data item per cell, organized as a single rectangle (with subjects as rows and variables as columns, and with a single header row), with a corresponding data dictionary. Metadata will be released in raw form without calculations on the raw data files, font color or highlighting as data, with human- and machine-readable variable names, links to raw data URLs, saved as a plain text file and uploaded with sequence data."

# Related Tools, Software and/or Code
tools: ["The raw and processed micro-CT data generated by this study can be accessed and manipulated using the Quantum GX2 Viewer and Analysis software, as well as Slicer (available at https://www.slicer.org/ ), Analyze 14.0 (available at https://analyzedirect.com/analyze14/) or other custom software specific for research (e.g. ImageJ (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html ) or microDICOM (https://www.microdicom.com/).", "All code developed as a part of this proposal will be deposited on GitHub at publication and released open source with an MIT license."]

# Standards for collection, etc.
standards: "The preclinical imaging data produced in this project will be collected using the consensus recommendations established by the Minimum Reporting Standards for _in vivo_ Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRSinMRS) (see https://doi.org/10.1002%2Fnbm.4484)."

# Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived
repository: "Primary repositories for preclinical imaging and associated metadata will be The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA; https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/), as well as the Imaging Data Commons (IDC; https://datacommons.cancer.gov/repository/imaging-data-commons), both maintained by the NIH/NCI."

# How scientific data will be findable and identifiable
findable: "Both TCIA and the IDC provide stable IDs to dataset collections representing the complete data collected for a particular publication. Primary references would be to a TCIA/IDC collection accession. The dataset records submitted for this project will additionally be listed in the Data Availability sections of all manuscripts published as part of this project."

# When and how long the scientific data will be made available
duration: "Data will be deposited at the time of publication and preserved for the duration of the grant funding."

# Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data
access_reuse: "We do not anticipate any significant factors limiting the access, distribution, or reuse of preclinical imaging data."

# Whether access to scientific data will be controlled
control_approvals: ""

# Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants (IF APPLICABLE)
privacy_hs: ""

# Oversight of Data Management and Sharing
oversight: "Oversight for, management of and compliance with this data management and sharing plan will be performed by the PI for this project. We will review our plan and identify any datasets that need to be shared, processed for sharing or updated twice annually. Additionally, we will implement aspects of our plan when manuscripts are published."
