# DMS Helper

✏️ A tool for composing your NIH Data Sharing Plan

As of January 2023, the NIH requires most grant proposals include a **Data Management and Sharing (DMS)** plan. Researchers need to detail how they will store and manage the digital data generated by the project, as well as how other scientists will be able to access it. To aid researchers, the [AnVIL](https://anvilproject.org/) Team has created this app to help make writing your plan easier!

**Try the app:** https://dmshelper.fredhutch.org/

You can learn more at [NIH's Data Sharing site](https://sharing.nih.gov/). We also encourage prospective DMS plan writers to check out our course, [online](https://hutchdatascience.org/NIH_Data_Sharing/) and on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/courses/fredhutch/nih_data_sharing).
